Advent of Code 2019 in Haskell

I discovered Haskell by following  the course [Introduction to functional programming](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-functional-programming) by the amazing [Erik Meijer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_(computer_scientist)). As I greatly enjoyed the course, I since then I have been thinking to learn more about Haskell.

What's better than trying to do the advent of code in the language ?

# Day 1
This was mostly about setting up the environment and understanding how to use the unit test framework (which I didn't learn about in the course)
